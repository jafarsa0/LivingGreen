					<h2>Effective farming methods</h2>
					<div id="owl">
						<div class="item">
							<p class="m">Smart farming solutions work through sensors. Farmers can monitor various conditions like soil moisture,
								water level, light, humidity, obstacles, and motion from anywhere by combining sensors, motion detectors,
								 button camera, and wearable devices. The IoT-based smart farming automates the irrigation system and is
								 highly efficient as compared to the conventional operations. <br> <br>
								 It is easy to follow the trends in organic farming, family farming, etc. With the help of IoT-based
								 farming applications. <br> <br>
								 Major IoT applications for farming are farm vehicle tracking, livestock monitoring, water level monitoring,
								 storage and soil monitoring, etc.
							 </p>

							 <h3>A)Plant and Soil Monitoring</h3>

							 <p>It is difficult to obtain the data of the farmlands with the size of hundreds of thousands of square yards.
								 The conventional method is to take samples from different parts to check the fertility, moisture content,
								 and chemical composition. But, the sampling method is not much accurate because the level and chemical
								 composition tend to change from one to another location. <br> <br>
								 With IoT, there is no room for the guesswork in farming. The soil sensors, which are at uniform distances
								  across the farmland, can alert farmer to any irregular conditions like high acidity or low moisture. The
									farmers can get an accurate soil data either by the dashboard or a customized mobile application.<br><br>
								 Monitoring of plant and soil can lead to higher RoI for farmers. As a part of precision farming, the soil
								 and plant monitoring include the following aspects:
							 </p>
							 <ol class="a">
							 		<li>Moisture and nutrients monitoring</li>
									<li>Water usage monitoring for optimal plant growth</li>
									<li>Fertilization and chemical composition monitoring</li>
									<li>Weather condition reporting</li>
									<li>Deciding the crop get the optimal yield</li>
							 </ol>
							 <p>In brief, precision farming or precision agriculture is one of the most popular applications of
								 IoT because of its plethora of benefits. The precision farming apps serve many objectives ranging
								  from managing irrigation and fertilization to providing support to local agronomy as per different
									seasons.
								</p>

								<h3>B)Use of Drones and AI</h3>
								<p>Farming or agricultural drones have started gaining ground as they can perform a variety of tasks.
									 Be it sprinkling pesticides, capturing farm photos using GPS technology, or giving inputs about water
									  and fertilizers level; drones can do them with ease. Drones can improve the agricultural practices in
										the domains of crop health assessment, irrigation, soil, and field analysis. <br> <br>

										As per the estimate of Grand View Research, the market size for these agricultural drones to exceed USD
										 3770 million by 2024. These drones are easy to control. Any person can control them either manually or
										 by using on-ground IoT sensors. The drones sent collected data to servers or systems from where the
										 end user can get them. In brief, the drone technology offers the real-time data and revamps the agriculture
										 industry. <br> <br>

										 Apart from drones, self-driving tractors are also available that farmers can control remotely and save
										  the labor costs.
									</p>

									<h3>C)Livestock Monitoring</h3>
									<p>Ranchers can monitor their cattle with ease thanks to livestock sensors. These sensors notify ranchers when
										 animals roam around in the field so that the ranchers can trace their location with ease.
										The livestock monitoring also enables ranchers to get data regarding the health of their cattle. <br> <br>
										 It can assist ranchers in two ways:
									</p>

                            <!-- put your content here!-->
                                
                            <ol class="a">
										<li>Identification of sick animals-It allows ranchers to separate the sick animals from the herd,
											thereby preventing the spread of disease.</li>
											<li>Location Tracing- It saves the rancherâ€™s time and labor cost because there is no need to follow
												 the herd every time.</li>
									</ol>

									<p>However, it is difficult to insert sensors among livestock. Apart from a collar, a wireless retrofitted
										 bolus is useful. It can communicate via Bluetooth.
									 </p>

									 <h3>D)Remote Weather Monitoring</h3>

									 <p>One of the most challenging factors for the farmers is the weather. Farmers need to measure the key

											conditions like temperature, rainfall, humidity, moisture, and chemical composition accurately to get
											 more crop throughout the year. Today, umpteen number of customizable sensors are available to assist
											 farmers in monitoring their crops and the weather conditions from remote places. <br> <br>
											 These sensors eliminate the requirement for farmers to present physically at the farm. In a way,
											  sensors can multiply the productivity and farmers can get more agricultural output without putting
												 additional efforts.
