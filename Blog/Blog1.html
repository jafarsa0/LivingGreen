					<h2>Conservation of forest lands</h2>
					<div id="owl">
						<div class="item">
							<p>Forest conservation is the habit or practice of planting and maintaining forested areas for 
								the benefit and sustainability of future generations to come. The conservation of forest 
								also stands & aims at a quick shift in the composition of trees species and age distribution. 
								Forest conservation involves the upkeep of the natural resources within a forest that are 
								beneficial to both humans and the environment. Forests are vital for human life because they 
								provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon &act as carbon sink, produce oxygen 
								which is vital for existence of life on the earth, so they are rightly called as earth lung, 
								help in regulating hydrological cycle, planetary climate, purify water, provide wild life 
								habitat (50% of the earth's biodiversity occurs in forests), reduce global warming, absorb 
								toxic gases & noise, reduce pollution, conserve soil,mitigate natural hazards such as floods 
								& landslides & so on. But now-a-days, forest cover is depleting rapidly due to many reasons 
								such as an expansion of agriculture, timber plantation, other land uses like pulp and paper 
								plantations, urbanization, construction of roads, industries, constitutes the biggest and 
								severe threat to the forest causing serious environmental damage. Thus, there is need of 
								public awareness. <br> <br>
								<b><i>Ways to conserve forest areas:</i></b>
							</p>

							<h3><u>A)Controlled Deforestation</u></h3>

							<p>While deforestation cannot be avoided completely, we must look to control it. Young and 
								immature trees should not be felled as far as possible. We must look to avoid large-scale 
								commercial deforestation as well. Adapting practices such as clear-cutting or selective 
								cutting will be beneficial in the long run.
							</p>

							<h3><u>B) Protect against Forest Fires</u></h3>

							<p>Forest fires are the most common and deadly cause of loss of forests. They can start due 
								to natural causes or can be accidents caused by man or even intentional in some cases. 
								Once a fire spreads in a forest it is very difficult to control. Precautions must be 
								taken for such incidents. Making fire lanes, spreading chemicals to control fire, clearing 
								out dry leaves and trees etc.
							</p>

							<h3><u>C) Afforestation</u></h3>

							<p>This is the process by which we plant more trees in the area. We try to increase the forest 
								cover by manual transplantation, or fresh plantation of trees. It is an attempt to balance 
								our ecosystem to reduce the effects of deforestation and environmental pollutions of all types.
							</p>

							<h3><u>D) Better Farming Practices</u></h3>

							<p>Slash and burn farming, overgrazing by cattle, shifting agriculture are all farming practices 
								that are harmful to the environment and particularly to forests. We must keep all these 
								practices under control. <br>

								Jhoom farming is one such practice we can employ to combat forest pollution. In the North-east 
								areas of India, where the land is kept barren after cutting the crops. Weeds and creepers and 
								wild plants grow on this land and make it fertile again in time. And then the land is cultivated 
								again.
